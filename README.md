HAVE IT BE KNOWN THAT THIS SCRIPT IS TO BE USED IN UNITY AND ONLY UNITY SINCE THIS WILL NOT WORK IN ANY OTHER GAME ENGINE

This took me a solid minute. Its recommended you have already made a lot of slices on the model in edit mode on blender (if you are using blender for the model) If you havent or cant make extra edges in the mesh, then you can download Pro Builder in Unity by doing the following:

Window/Package Manager then search Pro Builder and click the download/install button

after you have done this, you can use the knife tool in pro builder to make slices in the mesh before hand to make the effect of the mesh slicing better

THIS IS A REMADE VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL SCRIPT TO BE MADE WITHOUT PHOTON NETWORKING! IF YOU WOULD LIKE THE ORIGINAL, ITS IN MY REPOSITORY CALLED "MabbsMeshBreakingStuff"

THANK YOU!!!!!!!
